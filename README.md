## Fuitter

Fuitter is an open source Facebook page to website converter.

A lot of work is yet to be done and I would be more than happy if you could contribute too.

## Getting started

- Clone the repo
- bundle install
- Run rake sq:create and rake sq:migrate
- Copy the .env.example file and rename it to .env
- Fill in your version of data in .env file

### Things to add
- Save the data in db and images in s3
- Add a way to add data and pages for the site except from facebook page
- Create an easy way to reference the data in the template(website)
- Create an HTML editor (this is gona take some time)

### Why is the app ugly?

Coz, I want to finish the features first and my css skills are shit. Feel free to contribute.
